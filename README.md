# Effects-of-Covid19-Pandemic

The purpose of this project, titled is to conduct a comprehensive descriptive analysis of a dataset related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's well-being. The project aims to provide insights that can be used to formulate policy interventions and guide future research.

The project begins with an introduction highlighting the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals' social, psychological, and economic well-being. It emphasizes the sense of alienation experienced by many people and the loss of jobs and family connections. The primary objective is to analyze the dataset and present findings that can contribute to addressing these challenges.

The exploratory analysis section focuses on four variables: alienation, income, consult, and male. The mean, median, standard deviation, and range of the alienation variable are calculated, and an associated histogram is plotted to explore its distribution. The analysis reveals that the alienation variable is not normally distributed.

Further analysis is conducted by grouping the alienation variable based on gender (male or female), and separate summary statistics are calculated for each group. The income variable is also examined, and summary statistics are presented. Additionally, histograms are plotted to assess the distribution of income and to compare it across gender groups.

The project also addresses missing values and examines the variable "consult," converting it into a factor variable and providing a summary of its distribution. The relationship between gender and consult is explored through a mosaic plot.

The project includes a section on combinations, where the number of possible combinations of three elements is calculated using the "choose" function. This provides insight into the combinatorial aspects of the dataset.

The concept of currency shift is introduced, and US dollars are converted to Euros using the most recent exchange rate. The mean and standard deviation of both the income variable in USD and the converted income variable in Euros are calculated and compared. The expectation is that the income variable in Euros would have a lower mean and median due to the higher value of Euros relative to the US dollar.

Lastly, a centered income variable is created by subtracting the mean income from the original income variable. The mean and standard deviation of the centered income variable are computed. The project also includes calculations related to two formulas (form1 and form2) and finding the root of their difference.

The project concludes with an appendix section that references the code used in the analysis.

Overall, the project aims to provide a descriptive analysis of the dataset, examining variables related to alienation, income, and consultation, and drawing insights that can inform policy interventions and future research efforts related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals' well-being.
